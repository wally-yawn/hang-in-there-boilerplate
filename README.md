### Abstract:

[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

This app displays a series of random motivational posters, and a series of unmotivational posters. Users can save the generated posters or create their own, and they can also delete any unmotivational posters they don't want to see. This gives users the ability to inspired or uninspire themselves, depending on their mood.

### Learning Goals:

[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
The learning goals of this project was to become more familiar with front end development, specifically HTML, Javascript, and CSS.

### Wins + Challenges:

[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
Some of the big wins for the project were in overcoming the challenges that styling with CSS presented for me. The item that presented the biggest issue was in using flexbox to create the layout of the unmotivational posters grid, and in understanding how multiple CSS rules applied to them would be prioritized when assigned to items. I was able to use my cohort to understand flexbox better and eventually the CSS rules clicked in a way that I was able to match the styling of the comps.
